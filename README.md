# EV Range Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the driving range of electric vehicles based on specifications like battery capacity, efficiency, drivetrain, and top speed.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that helps estimate how far an EV can travel on a full charge. This can support manufacturers and users in making better design and purchase decisions.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains real-world EV specifications.
- Collected from an open-source platform (e.g., Kaggle).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model training (regression models)
4. Model evaluation (RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE)
5. Making predictions

## Result
The model predicts EV range accurately based on input specifications and helps understand how different features affect range.
